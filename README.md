# Auto Grader

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
Install python 3 on your computer with:
[Install Python](https://realpython.com/installing-python/)

```
python3 --version
sudo apt-get update 
sudo apt-get install python3.6
```

### Installing
You would be requiring python3 modules for proper execution of this program like os, time, sys, getopt and pathlib

```
python3.6 -m install os
python3.6 -m install time
python3.6 -m install sys
python3.6 -m install getopt
python3.6 -m install pathlib
```

## Running the tests

```
make
```
or if this is not working for some reason, you can run the program by,
```
python3 autograder.py github_list bu-cs540-20191s smart-pointer
```

### Break down of the command

Here github_list is a text file which includes all the GitHub usernames of the students.
bu-cs540-20191s is the class name for git classroom for the current semester and 
smart-pointer is the name of the assignment which you want to grade.

All these fields are required as cloning from git classroom is guided by all these command line inputs.
For example,
```
https://github.com/bu-cs540-20191s/container_in_c-atiwari3bu
```
## Deployment

You have to be present in the auto-grader directory to run this program.

Test cases should be added in test_cases folder of the software.

For running moss, I have only provided the case that runs if and only if there are text files in the submissions.
For example a.c, b.cpp, c.hpp, d.txt,etc.

Any executable files or folder present in the submission will not be discarded and the user has to discard it, depending on the situation.
The output generated by program should be like this : [Sample Output](https://github.com/atiwari3bu/auto_grader/blob/master/sample_output)

The log generated after running Moss, compiling and running the submissions, looks something like this: https://github.com/atiwari3bu/auto_grader/blob/master/report.txt
